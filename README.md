# Rest-API-Tests-PeselValidator
Automated tests to PeselValidator REST API endpoint available on: https://peselvalidatorapitest.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html, using rest-assured and TestNG libraries. Test cases were derived basing on documentation provided on Swegger, as well as the regulatory rules for assigning pesel numbers (https://www.gov.pl/web/gov/czym-jest-numer-pesel).

Rest of documentation will be added ASAP.
